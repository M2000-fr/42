The **42_Paris** repository is a central hub that gathers multiple cursus and personal projects developed at the **42 Paris School of Programming**. It is organized into three main sections:  
<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/Mechard-Organization/42_Paris_2017/tree/main_sub"><img src=".assets/images/42_Paris_2017_title_banner.png" alt="42_Paris_2017" width="200"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Mechard-Organization/42_Paris/tree/main_42_Paris/42_Paris_2023"><img src=".assets/images/42_Paris_2023_title_banner.png" alt="42_Paris_2023" width="200"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Mechard-Organization/Others/tree/main_sub"><img src=".assets/images/Others_title_banner.png" alt="Others" width="200"></a>
</p>

This structure allows a clear separation between different cursus generations and additional personal work. Each section contains exercises, projects, and resources reflecting the student journey at 42.

This folder contains the projects and materials from the **2017 cursus and Piscine** at 42. It includes foundational programming assignments, beginner exercises, and early-stage projects. The structure highlights the initial coding journey of a 42 student, from basic C projects to more advanced exercises, gradually building programming expertise.

Main content includes:
- Introductory exercises in C programming.  
- Pool challenges (short intensive projects designed for beginners).  
- Early cursus projects that establish the 42 methodology of peer-to-peer learning and self-driven exploration.  

This section is particularly useful for tracing the origins of the 42 training and observing the progression from novice to intermediate coding challenges.

This folder covers the **2023 cursus and Piscine** at 42. It represents a more modern and updated set of projects, aligned with the latest 42 curriculum. Compared to 2017, this section contains more refined, larger-scale projects and reflects current standards in programming and system design.

Main content includes:
- Core projects in C and C++, including algorithmic challenges.  
- Docker, system administration, and virtualization projects.  
- Group projects that simulate real-world collaboration (e.g., web development, networking, and containerization).  
- Specialized projects like **Inception**, **ft_transcendence**, or advanced C++ modules.  

This section provides insight into the current state of the 42 cursus and highlights the evolution of its teaching philosophy over time.

The **Others** folder gathers **personal projects** and experiments carried out at 42, outside the strict cursus requirements. It serves as a sandbox where custom scripts, utilities, and extra learning exercises are stored.

Main content includes:
- Personal automation scripts (e.g., helper commands, custom tooling).  
- Experimental projects that go beyond the official 42 curriculum.  
- Supplementary learning material and resources created during the cursus.  

This section showcases creativity, independence, and the extension of official training into personal exploration, embodying the spirit of continuous self-learning.
