# Ã‰cole 42 â€“ Personal Resources and Projects

This repository gathers personal notes, experiments, and resources related to my journey at **Ã‰cole 42**.  
Unlike the main cursus repositories, this section focuses on **side projects, extra exercises, and useful materials** that I developed outside of the official curriculum.  
It is meant as a complementary archive to support learning, experimentation, and creativity.
